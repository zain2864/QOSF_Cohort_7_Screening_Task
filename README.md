# QOSF_Cohort_7_Screening_Task

This is my implementation of Task 3: QSVM. 

###Problem Statement: 

Generate a Quantum Support Vector Machine (QSVM) using the iris dataset and try to propose a kernel from a parametric quantum circuit to classify the three classes(setosa, versicolor, virginica) using the one-vs-all format, the kernel only works as binary classification. Identify the proposal with the lowest number of qubits and depth to obtain higher accuracy. You can use the UUâ€  format or using the Swap-Test.
